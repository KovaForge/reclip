# AGENTS.md

## Git identity and wrappers (mandatory)

All git activity in this repo MUST go through a per-person wrapper. No bare `git push`.

| Agent | Wrapper |
|---|---|
| Aoife | `git-aoife` |
| Mikhail | `git-mikhail` |
| Declan | `git-declan` |
| Vladislava | `git-vladislava` |

Whoever pushes uses their own wrapper. Example: Declan pushes with `git-declan push`, Vladislava with `git-vladislava push`. Wrappers set committer identity and route the push to the correct per-person remote on the matching `github-<person>` SSH host.

Run `git-<person> whoami` to confirm identity and remote before pushing.
